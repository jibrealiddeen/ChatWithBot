# Purpose: Practice Python to talk with the user using input, conditionals, loops, and a function.

# Greet the user
print("Hello! I'm RoboPal! Let's chat")

# Ask for the user's name
name = input("What's your name? ")

# Print a greeting using the user's name
print(f"Nice to meet you, {name}! ")

# Define the chatbot conversation function
def ask_questions():
    '''
    This function runs an interactive chatbot that asks the user questions
    about pizza, favorite colors, and a fun choice between the moon or sea. 
    It keeps running until the user says "bye".
